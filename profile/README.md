The **Falagka** project is specifically engineered to support space industry organizations in comprehending, analyzing, and safeguarding against sophisticated cyber threats that are unique to their sector. By learning directly from hacker attacks, our platform integrates data from a wide array of space industry-specific sources, identifies emerging patterns, and visualizes insights to offer a detailed perspective on the tactics and trends of cyber adversaries targeting space technologies.

**Our primary objectives are to:**<br>
Develop Adaptive Learning Models: Craft advanced machine learning algorithms capable of detecting new and evolving threats specifically engineered against space sector infrastructure, including satellite communications and ground station networks.<br>
Deliver Actionable Intelligence: Provide comprehensive reports that empower space agencies, satellite operators, and aerospace manufacturers to fortify their cybersecurity defenses, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of mission-critical operations.<br>

**Key Features:**<br>
Sector-Specific Threat Intelligence: Tailored cybersecurity insights focused on the threats most prevalent in the space industry.<br>
Real-Time Anomaly Detection: Leveraging state-of-the-art AI to monitor, detect, and respond to threats in real time, safeguarding sensitive data transmitted to and from space.<br>
Customizable Dashboards: Visual tools that allow organizations to see their security posture at a glance, with data visualizations that map out attack vectors and potential vulnerabilities.<br>

By aligning our cybersecurity efforts with the specific needs of the space industry, the Falagka project aims to elevate the standards of digital protection, ensuring that space operations can progress securely and without disruption from malicious cyber activities.
